### Acer Predator Webcam Mount

In order to mound my webcam on the top of my monitor without covering part it and creating a notch, I created a custom webcam mount.  
It uses a ball mount, like a tripod, to have full flexibility.  

Required parts:  
- 3D printed part, [GitHub](prints/acer-predator-webcam-mount) or [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/523723-acer-predator-webcam-mount)
- a ball mount, I used this https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09P9SCRHT  
- a 1/4" screw, the one I used is 12.7 mm from this set https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09XDR11BM
- some double-sided tape, I used https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00SFSRN0E
